To build WebIRC use ant script in "ant" folder. WebIRC uses 
modified gwt-user.jar library, which you can download from:
http://webirc.googlecode.com/files/gwt-user.jar
Also it uses sockets library:
http://webirc.googlecode.com/files/Sockets.jar
These libraries should be located in GWT home folder (see
gwt.home parameter in the file ant/build.properties)
